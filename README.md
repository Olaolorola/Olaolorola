Hi there 👋 I’m @Olaolorola

- 👀 I’m interested in: Creating immersive, story-driven games with engaging puzzles. I love the challenge of designing games that are both entertaining and thought-provoking, and I'm especially passionate about open-source projects and building a community around game development.

- 🌱 I’m currently learning: Advanced game mechanics, narrative design, and exploring tools for developing open-source games. I’m diving into Python, JavaScript, and working with platforms like GitHub to collaborate with other developers and creatives.

- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on: Open-source game projects, puzzle design, interactive storytelling, and any project that blends technology with creativity. If you're into designing games or have a project idea that aligns with these themes, I’d love to connect!
